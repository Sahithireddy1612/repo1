<h2>To Get US Residency Requires The COVID Jab </h2>
<img src="C:\Users\sahit\Downloads\istockphoto-1585070896-1024x1024.jpg"/>
<p><pre/>This Covid vaccine is being gradually added to every list of requirements that is available, from immigration to the childhood schedule to school attendance. This is despite how the shot has completely failed to perform up to the promise of the first year. This is fully known by vast swaths of the world’s population, and yet US bureaucracies persist in their impositions without the slightest sense that they ought to acquiesce to the reality that everyone knows. </p>
<p>It’s helpful to think of a Covid experience as a never-ending house of horrors, with room after room of scandal and outrage, so much so that you never quite get through it. There simply are not enough researchers or column inches to cover it all. 

In the past, any one of these outrages would be enough to call forth enormous public debate. Introduce them all at once – starting March 2020 – and gradually unfold and codify them over a few years and many features slip through the cracks. 

Consider, for example, the continued requirement that any legally immigrating person coming to the US from another country and seeking residency is absolutely required to get the Covid-19 vaccine, a shot widely admitted not to protect against infection or spread and is associated with injury on a scale without pharmaceutical precedent. 

And yet the US government requires it. 

The evidence is here from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. 


Note the language: “to prevent the following diseases.” 

That is completely untrue. You cannot make it true simply by claiming that it prevents something. It does nothing of the kind, despite its moniker of being a vaccine. All the others are indeed vaccines that generally prevent the disease because they are sterilizing shots. The Covid-19 shot is not. And yet there it is, riding the coattails of public-health valor from past ages. 

It is generally not possible to avoid the requirement. You can appeal for a religious exemption, which involves several rounds of correspondence and documentation. They have variously been granted after much headache, bureaucracy, and expense. Very few will go to the trouble. 

Meanwhile, the US is currently experiencing a wave of immigration from asylum seekers which this country has never seen in raw numbers before. There is no requirement that these people coming across the Southern border and then shipped around the country face any such requirement of Covid vaccination. That only kicks in if you seek to immigrate the old-fashioned way, which is to say, by seeking legal permission. 

Based on reports from Archive.org, it appears that the addition of the Covid-19 shot was in the first week of October 2021. It was not there and then it was, by pure bureaucratic edict. Edit file, submit, done. 

This was long after it was well known that the vaccine did not stop infection or transmission, and long after the CDC was aware of the health risks of the vaccine. It was also a time when vaccine uptake was dramatically dropping from the levels of the initial enthusiasm from earlier that year. 

By this time, vast numbers had grown skeptical and were willing to take their chances. The market for shots was headed south. It appears that immigrant populations – who had not been required to get it for the first ten months of 2021 – were roped into the market as mandates began to invade private workplaces and cities. In other words, this was a forced recruitment of immigrant populations to boost the demand for the shots. 

The Biden administration attempted to impose such mandates on the whole of the private sector. The Supreme Court blocked that measure in January 2022. So most were repealed. But the one for legal immigration stayed, and has not been challenged in court. 

There is a darker way to understand this policy move too. It serves as a filtering mechanism. Many people around the world were fleeing shot mandates from their home countries. Adding this one to the list of required injections was a way to signal to the world: the US would not provide any sanctuary to shot refuseniks, so don’t bother even trying. 

It also operates as a culling mechanism against anti-lockdown and anti-mandate opinions. It assured that the US would not be allowing people to work here who think for themselves, look at evidence, or otherwise refuse to bow to the pharma agenda. 

The CDC further elaborates on the regulation: it must be within 12 months and it does pertain to children too. There is a narrow range of exemption for repeated shots but that requires additional paperwork. 


There is simply no basis for this mandate at all. The vaccine is not efficacious in the normal sense of that term. Nor is it necessary for healthy adults, much less children, who face a near-zero risk of medically significant outcomes. There is the additional peculiarity that whatever immune response occurs from the shot fades quickly, and ever less pertains to the existing strain in the community of this fast-mutating virus. 

In other words, there is nothing defensible about this policy at all. It is keeping untold families apart and preventing US citizens from moving to the US with children and spouses from other countries who decline the shots. They have worked to get back but the vaccine mandate here bars them from doing so. Sadly, there are few in Congress willing to take up the causes and do something about this. 

It’s the sort of rule that is enforced with no rationality at all but which benefits powerful pharmaceutical companies. The issue has been barely covered in the media at all, and there are currently no real efforts ongoing to push back because the victims are powerless and much of the world has moved on. 

Meanwhile, this Covid vaccine is being gradually added to every list of requirements that is available, from immigration to the childhood schedule to school attendance. This is despite how the shot has completely failed to perform up to the promise of the first year. This is fully known by vast swaths of the world’s population, and yet US bureaucracies persist in their impositions without the slightest sense that they ought to acquiesce to the reality that everyone knows.

<h2>Why was the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA Vaccine not recalled in Febraury 2021</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\sahit\OneDrive\Desktop\vaccine.jpg"/>
<p>It sure seems like the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, for an undisclosed reason, was privileged over the J&J product by regulators, such that even more than 1,000 deaths in three months were not considered a “novel safety concern or risk requiring label changes.” Not to mention withdrawing the product from the market. </p>
<p>According to Stat News, on May 5, 2022, The J&J adenovirus Covid vaccine “was limited to people 18 and older who cannot take one of the other available vaccines for medical reasons, or who simply will not agree to be vaccinated with one of the messenger RNA vaccines made by Moderna and by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech.”

The reason?

Peter Marks, the FDA’s vaccines lead, told STAT the agency reached its decision after a recent review of the data on the vaccine revealed another person in this country had died after receiving it — the ninth such death — in the first quarter of the year.

[BOLDFACE ADDED]

“If we see deaths and there is an alternative vaccine that is not associated with deaths but is associated with similar efficacy…we felt it was time at this point to make a statement on the [product’s] fact sheet that this was not a first-line vaccine,” said Marks.

With one death for every 2 million doses given in this country, the FDA decided that is a risk most people don’t need to take, Marks said.

Nine deaths. 

Compared to “an alternative vaccine that is not associated with deaths” – a statement made on May 5, 2022.

Let’s look at one such “alternative vaccine:”

A document dated FEBRUARY 28, 2021 (almost a whole year BEFORE the Peter Marks statements), recently brought to my attention by a Brownstone reader, presents an analysis of “post-authorization adverse event reports” on the BioNTech/Pfizer Covid vaccine, as requested by the FDA for Pfizer/BioNTech’s Biologics License Application (BLA).

This report, marked “CONFIDENTIAL” but publicly available on phmpt.org, is dated just 3 months after “the first temporary authorisation for emergency supply on 01 December 2020,” which is when the UK gave Emergency Use Authorization to the product.

In the report, we see that there were 1,223 deaths among the 42,086 total cases analyzed in the report. NOTE: the total case number is not the number of people who received the vaccine. It is also not the number of people in a clinical trial. It is the number of adverse event “cases” that were analyzed by Pfizer “on behalf of BioNTech” (aside: the Pfizer-BioNTech relationship is worthy of a lot more analysis than it has received) after the product had been administered internationally for three months.


Over 1,000 deaths in the first three months of administration. The actual number of doses that had been shipped when the report was published is redacted. The number that had been administered up to that date is not reported.

Pfizer’s “DISCUSSION”
The data do not reveal any novel safety concerns or risks requiring label changes and support a favorable benefit risk profile of the BNT162b2 vaccine.

NOTE: I’m guessing that the key word here, for legal purposes, is “novel.” They must have already known about all the adverse events in this report, including death, before the product was authorized and distributed, so technically this report does not include anything “novel,” or new.

Pfizer’s “SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION”
Review of the available data for this cumulative PM experience confirms a favorable benefit: risk balance for BNT162b2.

NOTE: There is no discussion of any benefits in the report.

My Conclusion
Distribution of the J&J shot was limited and the label was changed after NINE associated deaths. The “alternatives” were supposedly “not associated with deaths.” But a report after just 3 months of the initial authorization of one of the two main alternatives shows OVER ONE THOUSAND deaths.

It sure seems like the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, for an undisclosed reason, was privileged over the J&J product by regulators, such that even more than 1,000 deaths in three months were not considered a “novel safety concern or risk requiring label changes.” Not to mention withdrawing the product from the market.

My Hypothesis
I believe the BioNTech and Moderna Covid mRNA vaccines were predetermined as the only Covid vaccine products that would be not just aggressively marketed by the public health and regulatory bodies themselves, but also the only products that would remain on the market regardless of any reported adverse events, including thousands of deaths.

The reason for this, I surmise (not enough concrete proof yet to make this a definite claim), is that those two products were designed in tandem by the international biowarfare/biodefense network that ran the entire Covid pandemic and response. The biowarfare network was so hellbent on demonstrating the “safety and efficacy” of its precious mRNA platform that nothing could stand in the way of these products – especially not reports of their total lack of efficacy and jaw-droppingly horrendous safety profile.

"It is respectfully submitted that State Government run by DMK political party has banned live telecast of the auspicious occasion of 'Pran Pratishtha' of Lord Ram at Ayodhya in all the temples across the state of Tamil Nadu," the plea said as per the news agency.

"The government has also banned all kinds of poojas, Archana and Annadanam (poor feeding) bhajans on this auspicious occasion. Such arbitrary exercise of power by the State Government (through police officials) per se violates fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution," it added.

<h2>Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra Live Updates, Day 9: Will PM Modi decide who visits temples, asks Rahul Gandhi, slams govt over being ‘stopped from visiting shrine’</h2>
<p>Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra Live Updates, Day 9: The Congress will hold demonstrations across the country on Monday evening over what it claimed to be "planned attacks" on the convoys of Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\sahit\OneDrive\Desktop\rahul.jpg"/>
<p><pre/>Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra Live Updates, Day 9: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, whose Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is currently passing through Assam, slammed the authorities for allegedly stopping him from visiting the Sri Sri Sankar Dev Satra temple in Nagaon. “It seems like only one person is allowed to enter a temple today. Will PM Modi decide who visits temples,” Rahul asked.
The Congress will hold demonstrations across the country on Monday evening over what it claimed to be “planned attacks” on the convoys of Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam. In a late night post on X on Sunday, Congress general secretary, organisation, K C Venugopal alleged that since the yatra’s entry in Assam, “the most corrupt chief minister in India has been carrying out relentless attacks on our convoys, properties and leaders using his goons.”

Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh’s car was allegedly attacked and media persons accompanying the Yatra “manhandled” by miscreants in Assam’s Sonitpur on Sunday, news agency PTI quoted a party leader as saying. Meanwhile, the party also accused BJP workers of tearing down its posters and banners and attacking its vehicles in Assam’s Lakhimpur ahead of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra passing through the town on Saturday.</p>
<h2>Will BJP decide who should go to a temple and at what time, asks Congress leader K C Venugopal.</h2>
<p>After Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was allegedly stopped from visiting the Sri Sri Sankar Dev Satra temple in Nagaon, Congress leader K C Venugopal slammed the BJP and said that the 'country had entered a new phase of democracy where the BJP would decide who should go to a temple and at what time.'

Taking to social media platform X, Venugopal wrote: 'This dictatorial regime must realise that its days are numbered. The people of India will not allow such authoritarianism. We will not budge till we are allowed to bow before Sri Sri Srimanta Sankardeva.'</p>
<h2>“Atrocious behaviour by entitled dynast": BJP attacks Rahul Gandhi for allegedly "losing cool" over Jai Shri Ram chants</h2>
<p>The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has criticised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for allegedly "losing" his temper in response to chants of "Jai Shri Ram" and slogans during the Assam leg of his ongoing Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra and called the Wayanad MP 'entitled dynast'.

BJP National spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla took to X and said that Rahul Gandhi "arrogantly charged" at the crowd.

"Some people chanted Jai Shri Ram & Modi Modi during his yatra, so Rahul Gandhi arrogantly charges at them. Security personnel stopped him. Mohabbat ki dukaan or Ahankaar ki Dukaan. Shameful & atrocious behaviour by the entitled dynast! He even made kissing actions to the crowd !!" he said on Monday.</p>
<h2>BJP have always tried to be a middleman between us and our God," says Congress leader Supriya Shrinate</h2>
<p>"Going to a temple can be anyone's matter of faith. Himanta-led government is hindering the faith (of Rahul Gandhi). We wanted to go to the shrine (birthplace of saint Srimanta Sankardeva) peacefully. They have always tried to be a middleman between us and our God," says Congress leader. 

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, whose Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is currently passing through Assam, slammed the authorities for allegedly stopping him from visiting the Sri Sri Sankar Dev Satra temple in Nagaon. “It seems like only one person is allowed to enter a temple today. Will PM Modi decide who visits temples,” Rahul asked.</p>
